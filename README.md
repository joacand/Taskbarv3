# Taskbarv3

A lightweight taskbar alternative to be used on a secondary monitor. Developed with WPF using .NET Core and .NET Standard frameworks.

## Functionality

* SongViewer - Displays the current song playing in Spotify or Foobar2000
* Add shortcuts - Add any program shortcut dynamically with an optional icon
* Philips Hue dim control - Dim a Philips Hue light with a quick slider on the taskbar
* CPU usage viewer - Displays CPU usage (0-100%)
* Media controls - Play/Pause and Next media controls for controlling music playback

The icons are the dynamically added program shortcuts. They can be started by left-click and are removed by right-click. "Radio - Hunter Bears" is the current playing song. Media controls are visible to the left of the date/time. Slider is Hue dimming control.

## What is this?

Taskbarv3 stems from the time where there were no good alternatives for taskbars on secondary monitors. The functionality is mostly tailored to my needs and might not suit everyone - but it is here if someone wants to use it. It is a lightweight taskbar to be used on a secondary monitor.

## Todo
* Possibility to toggle functions in the configuration file, such as turning off Philip Hue integration for people who does not have Philip Hue lights
* Possiblity to change start-up location so it can be used on other monitors than the secondary
* Fix the jagged quality of some shortcut icons
